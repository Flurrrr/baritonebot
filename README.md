## Things to-do:
• Add functionality to response/cringe because right now it just sends embeds

• dm users when they have been un/muted/kicked/optout/un/ban (some code for this is in the optout file)

• make the time in server/user info look nice (rounding)

• add gif support/improve the emote command

• add days to clear messages or max/none to ban command

• add durations to mute command

• add more options to the embed command (field, footer, author, image, etc) will probably require a new function in [const.py](cogs/const.py)

• be able to update rules, or add/remove (maybe list) them kinda like responses

• add a faq command exactly like rules command but it lists faq things

• find a way to make the "Watching" in the status changeable with commands

• maybe add a nitro boost event like join/leave instead of discords default

• have a xp/rank system where it either tracks total messages or you get random amount of xp (like 10-20) per message

• read [this](https://gist.github.com/InterStella0/b78488fb28cadf279dfd3164b9f0cf96) and see if its better then current help command
